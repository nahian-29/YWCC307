Two key arguments are as follows:

The community of investors and startups are simultaneously growing in the New York City. 
The VC investments in NYC are mostly done in the Media and Entertainment industries. 
The slide content effectively conveys the main point since it reflects factual evidence 
and data to prove its arguments further. It shows real data and numbers which makes it more persuasive. 
Primarily, the VC M&E investment bar graph portrays how the percentage of investments have been increasing each year from 2002 to 2011. 
Although, there are a few times where the investments decreased from 2007 to 2010, but in 2011 the rate of investment was at its peak. 
On the other hand, the statement of over $2 billion being invested in the M&E sector by VCs in NYC supports its argument directly. 
The rest of the slide also claims about the digital focus of VC funds and how more digital media firms have opened offices in NYC. 
Additionally, the slides also talk about digital exits that contribute to the arguments of why digital media M&E would be a promising choice for its investors. 
Pointing out big company examples of Google, Twitter, and Ebay also solidifies the arguments made throughout the slide.
